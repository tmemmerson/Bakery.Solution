## **PROTECTING YOUR DATA**

*EDIT* * Step 0: go to $URL$ and sign up for an account to get a free API key

* Step 1: create a .gitignore file in the top level of your project directory. populate the file as shown in step 1 of the image below.

* Step 2: commit that .gitignore file (this prevents your sensitive information like your API key being shown to others). **DO NOT PROCEED TO STEP 3 UNTIL YOU DO THIS!**

* Step 3: create a .env file in the top level of your project directory. populate the file as shown in step 3 of the image below _(replacing YourKeyGoesHere with the API key you received from step 0)_

![setup](https://coding-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/readme-image.jpg "Set up instructions")

* Step 4: in your terminal type "npm install" and submit. this will install the files necessary to utilize this app.

* Step 5: in your terminal type "npm run build". this will build the app and place those files in a directory labeled "/dist". From here, you can right-click the index.html file and open in your browser or simply drag-and-drop into a browser window. 

* Step 6: enjoy
